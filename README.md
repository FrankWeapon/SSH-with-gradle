# SSH-with-gradle
+ The project was created in Intellij where I run into a problem which is that the files in resources can't be deployed automatically. I did the following settings:
  1. file -> project structure
  2. Artifacts -> output layout
  3. click the + button (add copy of) -> Directory content
  4. select the resources dir
